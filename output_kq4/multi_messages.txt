Fine.
You wear the locket.
=====
1643

Here lies Newberry Will,
His life was finished 'cause he took ill,
But none'll miss him, he should've been wiser,
'Tis his own fault, for bein' such a miser.
=====
Here lies the body of Mary Ann Lowder,
She burst while drinking a seidlitz powder,
Called from this world to her heavenly rest,
She should have waited till it effervesced.

=====
To the ever living memory of Hiram Bennet,
baby son of Edward and Sarah Bennet,
who by a sudden-surprize fell asleep,
the 11th day of November, 1553
Aged 6 months.
=====
Six feet beneath
This funeral wreath
Is laid upon the shelf
One Jerry Jones,
Who dealt in bones,
And now he's bones himself.
=====
Lord Coningsby
1559 to 1626

Sleepeth here in peace:
an honorable man, a valiant soldier.
He served his country well.
=====
I plant these shrubs upon your grave, dear wife,
That something on this spot may boast of life.
Shrubs must whither and all earth must rot;
Shrubs may revive: but you, thank heaven, will not.
=====
Beneath this stone, a lump of clay,
Lies Uncle Peter Dan'els,
Who, early in the month of May,
Took off his winter flannels.
=====
Dr. I Letsome

When people's ill they come to I,
I physics, bleeds, and sweats 'em;
Sometimes they live, Sometimes they die;
What's that to I? I Letsome.

=====
Here I lie with my three daughters,
Who died drinking Chelt'nam waters.
If we had stuck to Epsom Salt,
We should not sleep in this cold vault.

=====
Strong and athletic was my frame;
Far from my native home I came,
And manly fought with Simon Byrne;
Alas! but liv'd not to return.

Reader, take warning by my fate,
Lest you should rue your case too late;
If you have ever fought before,
Determine now to fight no more.
=====
Betty Cowden
1650 to 1669

Here lieth the body of Betty Cowden
Who would live longer but she couden;
Sorrow and grief made her decay
When she lost her lover at sea one day.
=====
Whoe'er you are,
tread softly, I entreat you,
For if he chance to wake,
be sure he'll eat you.
=====
At length, my friends, the feast of life is o'er,
I've eat sufficient, and I'll drink no more;
My night is come, I've spent a jovial day,
'Tis time to part, but oh!--what is to pay?

=====
1546

Reader, here lies--but forbear
To read more without a tear,
One--I cannot speak the rest,
You may weep. I'll smite my breast,
Grief preventing, and this stone,
Too small to be written on.
Only this--a little boy,
Willy--in Abram's bosom's laid.

=====
Rebecca Freeland
1598

She drank good ale, good punch and wine
And lived to the age of 99.
=====
1634 to 1672

She done her best.
=====
Here lies a poor woman who was always tired,
She lived in a house where help wasn't hired:
Her last words on earth were: "Dear friends, I am going
To where there's no cooking, or washing, or sewing,
For everything there is exact to my wishes,
For where they don't eat there's no washing of dishes,
I'll be where loud anthems will always be ringing,
But having no voice I'll be quit of the singing,
Don't mourn for me now, don't mourn for me never,
I am going to do nothing for ever and ever."
=====
Dentist Brown

Stranger! Approach this spot with gravity!
John Brown is filling his last cavity.
=====
There's nothing in the old boat.
It didn't help "James" and it won't help you.
=====
This ogre looks MEAN!
Better get out of there...FAST!
=====
You don't have time for that now!
Better get out of there...FAST!
=====
You weren't fast enough, Rosella!
You were nothing but a bite-sized morsel for that big dog!
=====
Now you blew it!
You foolishly spoke to the ogress, and drew her attention toward you. Now she's headed your way!
=====
Poor Rosella!
Looks like you'll join the deer in the stew pot tonight.
=====
The ogre roars, "Fe, fi, fo, fum! 
I smell the blood of a..." 
=====
You have absolutely no way of reaching that trapdoor as it's too high. And moving the heavy furniture is out of the question.
Forget it.
=====
How did you get here without the scarab?
You will be the next victim of the mummy!!
=====
You just got out of there!
Why go back in?
=====
You think to yourself,
NOW WHAT!!
=====
The henchmen have taken your rose and you no longer have the gold key!
It looks like you're destined to be...Mrs. Edgar!
=====
As she breathes her last, Lolotte manages to gasp,
"I don't know how...but I'll get you for this..."
=====
You hear the henchmen returning.
Perhaps, they are setting you free!
=====
The fireplace is unlit and cold.
An empty iron pot sits in it.
=====
Rosella is much heartened by this news!
"Where is the land of Tamir?"
=====
In thy face I see
The map of honor, truth, and loyalty.
=====
Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.
Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
And let us all to meditation.
=====
Look, how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
=====
The world is grown so bad,
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
=====
O, I have passed a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days.
=====
Is the chair empty?
Is the sword unswayed?
Is the king dead?
The empire unpossessed?
=====
Tut! I have done a thousand dreadful things
As willingly as one would kill a fly.
=====
He jests at scars, that never felt a wound.
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
=====
See! how she leans her cheek upon her hand:
O! that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek.
=====
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father, and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
=====
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet.
=====
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
=====
Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
=====
Of comfort no man speak:
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth;
Let's choose executors and talk of wills.
=====
You may my glories and my state depose,
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.
=====
How sour sweet music is
when time is broke and no proportion kept!
So is it in the music of men's lives.
=====
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
=====
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon, and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
And sometimes lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab.
=====
You spotted snakes with double tongue,
Thorny hedge-hogs, be not seen;
Newts, and blind-worms, do no wrong;
Come not near our fairy queen.
=====
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Makes ill deeds done!
=====
I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
=====
The day shall not be up so soon as I,
To try the fair adventure of tomorrow.
=====
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world!
=====
To hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature;
to show virtue her own feature, scorn her
own image, and the very age and body of the
time his form and pressure.
=====
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world.
=====
You have let your lantern go out.
Death is surely close at hand...
=====
So, all's well, that ends well. Until next time...!

                    Good-bye!
